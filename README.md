# TPC-H benchmark scripts for Greenplum PXF.

Supported versions:
Greenplum 5.*, 6.*
Open Source Greenplum 5.*, 6.*

## TPC-H Information

Based on version 2.17.1 of TPC-H.

## Query Options

You can have the queries execute with "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" in order to see exactly the 
query plan used, the cost, the memory used, etc.  This is done in tpch_variables.sh
like this:
EXPLAIN_ANALYZE="true"

Note: The EXPLAIN ANALYZE option is only available when using the standard TPC-H 
queries.

## Storage Options

Table storage is defined in functions.sh and is configured for optimal performance. 

## Prerequisites

1. Supported Database installed and running
2. Connectivity is possible to the MASTER_HOST and from the Data Nodes / Segment Hosts
3. Root access


## Installation

1. ssh to the master host with root
ssh root@mdw

2. Download the tpch.sh file
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankgh/TPC-H/master/tpch.sh > tpch.sh
chmod 755 tpch.sh

## Variables and Configuration

By default, the installation will create the scripts in /pxf-performance/TPC-H on the 
Master host.  Variables can be changed by editing the dynamically configured 
/root/tpch_variables.sh file that is created the first time tpch.sh is run.  

Also by default, TPC-H files are generated on each Segment Host / Data Node in the 
Segment's PGDATA/pxf-performance directory.  If there isn't enough space in this
directory in each Segment, you can create a symbolic link to a drive location that
does have enough space.

## Execution

1. Execute tpch.sh
./tpch.sh

## Notes

- tpch_variables.sh file will be created with variables you can adjust
- Files for the benchmark will be created in a sub-directory named pxf-performance
located in each segment directory on each segment host / data node.
You can update these directories to be symbolic links to better utilize the disk 
volumes you have available.
- Example of running tpch as root as a background process:
nohup ./tpch.sh > tpch.log 2>&1 < tpch.log &

## TPC-H Minor Modifications

1. Query alternative 15 was used in favor of the original so it is easier to parse in
these scripts.  Performance is essentially the same for both versions.
2. Query 1 documentation doesn't match query provided by TPC.  Range is supposed to be
dynamically set between 60 and 120 days and substitution doesn't seem to be working
with qgen.  So, hard code 90 days until this can be fixed by TPC.
